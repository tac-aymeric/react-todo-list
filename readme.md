# Simple TODO app

The repo has 2 folders: 
`api` contains the code of a simple API written with Node, Express, and MongoDB.
`front` contains the code of a (really) simple frontend written in React.

Please note design is not my best point...

# How to run

You need docker installed on your machine.
In the root directory, run `docker-compose build`, then `docker-compose up`.
You can now access the app via `localhost:1996`.
